== Installation ==

This is how the WooCommerce integration with Packlink PRO works.

**1. Install and configure the plugin**

- You can install the Packlink PRO plugin in one of two ways:
  - Option a. From your WordPress back office go to "Plugins" > "Add new" > then, search for "Packlink" > "Install now".
  - Option b. Go to <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/packlink-pro-shipping">https://wordpress.org/plugins/packlink-pro-shipping</a> and click on the "Download" button. Then, from your WordPress back office "Plugins" section click on "Add new" > "Upload plugin" and upload the downloaded zip file.

- Once you have installed the plugin, login to the Packlink PRO website and click on "Configuration" in the top right-hand corner.

- From the left-hand menu, select "Connect your shop" and click on the WooCommerce logo to generate the API key to synchronize both platforms.

- Copy this API key in Packlink PRO module in WooCommerce.

- You can define the dimensions of your most common parcels and pickup address. This information is automatically synchronized in WooCommerce.

**2. Sync with your Packlink PRO account**

- In WooCommerce back office, select WooCommerce > Packlink PRO from the left-hand menu.

- Paste the API key you copied from your Packlink PRO account and click on the Log in button.

- The module will automatically synchronize your default parcel dimensions, pickup address, and shipping services from Packlink PRO (this process can take several minutes).

- Select the shipping services you want to use. You can configure the name of each service and whether you show the carrier logo to your customers.

- You can define your pricing policy by choosing from the following options: direct Packlink prices, percentage of Packlink price, fixed price by weight, or fixed price by shopping cart.


**3. Use the module**

- If an order has been paid or payment was accepted by you, the shipment will be automatically imported into your Packlink PRO account.

- You have the option to manually send an order to Packlink PRO by opening order details page and clicking in "Create draft" in the "Packlink PRO Shipping" section on the right side.

- Packlink PRO is always updated with all shipments that are ready for shipment in WooCommerce.

- You only need to access Packlink PRO for payment. Sender and recipient details are synchronized with WooCommerce data.
